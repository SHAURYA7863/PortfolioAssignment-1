I use the MIT license almost exclusively on all of my open source projects. As far as I’m concerned my best options are either to make my code proprietary or, if it’s open source, then I will always use the MIT license. I refuse to use the GPL because it’s far too liberal even for a liberal guy like me. The MIT license is a great choice because it allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code, it’s business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization. Here’s why I use the MIT license and what it’s all about.
